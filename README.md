# Knowledge Graph

This repo contains the code used to access, analyse and augment the knowledge graph for the UCL Data Science for Cultural Heritage MSc project: _"Refinement and study of the knowledge graph of the collections of the Wellcome Collection

The project is orchestrated with docker, with the aim to make the analysis as reproducible as possible.
